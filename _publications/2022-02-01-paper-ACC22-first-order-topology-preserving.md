Interaction topology through which agents achieve collaboration in multi-agent systems is of fundamental importance. Recently, many efforts have been devoted to the problem of topology inference, e.g., the trajectory information of mobile agents is utilized to regress the topology. In this paper, we develop a distributed topology-preserving collaboration algorithm for multi-agent systems against topology inference attacks. The novelties lie in that: i) By adding well-designed noises to the system states, the irregularity of the state evolution is largely enhanced, making the underlying topology hard to be inferred accurately from the observations over the system; ii) By dividing the added noises into the random and the disturbing terms with mutual compensation properties, the proposed algorithm guarantees the convergence of the system state, which applies to both undirected and directed topology structures. Specifically, the mean square convergence rate and the non-asymptotic error bound are derived. Extensive simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
